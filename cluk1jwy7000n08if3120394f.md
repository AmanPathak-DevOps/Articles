### Introduction

Welcome to the world of FluxCD, a powerful tool for DevOps Engineers managing Kubernetes deployments. In this blog series, we’ll explore how FluxCD simplifies the process of updating and deploying Kubernetes manifests. Today, we’ll start with a quick overview of FluxCD’s workflow, covering key steps from setup to deployment.

### High-Level Overview

**1\. Bootstrapping:** The first step is bootstrapping. This involves FluxCD creating a GitHub repository on your GitHub account. By default, the repository is named flux-config. Additionally, we’ll include the link to our Kubernetes Manifest file repository in one of the YAML files within the flux-config repository.

**2\. Monitoring:** Once the Kubernetes Manifest file repository link is added to the YAML file, FluxCD continuously monitors for any changes.

**3\. Updating Manifest Files:** Suppose a DevOps Engineer makes changes to the Kubernetes Manifest file repository.

**4\. Alerting:** FluxCD, As flux-config repository keeping an eye on the given repository link. So, it’s get notification about the new changes in the given repository link

**5\. Deploying Updated Manifest Files:** FluxCD then proceeds to deploy the new changes to your AWS Elastic Kubernetes Cluster.
