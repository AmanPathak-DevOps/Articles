**Introduction:**

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on installing Ubuntu 20.04 on VirtualBox within a Windows 10 environment. Virtualization allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single machine, enabling you to explore and experiment with different platforms without affecting your primary system. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of setting up Ubuntu 20.04, a popular Linux distribution, on VirtualBox, a powerful virtualization software.

**Prerequisites:**

Before we dive into the installation process, there are a few prerequisites you’ll need to have in place:

1.  Windows 10: Ensure that you have a Windows 10 operating system installed on your computer. This tutorial specifically covers Ubuntu 20.04 installation on Windows 10.

2\. VirtualBox: Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox from the official website ([https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/)). VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software that allows you to create and manage virtual machines.

3\. Ubuntu 20.04 ISO: Download the Ubuntu 20.04 ISO file from the official Ubuntu website ([https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)). The ISO file contains the installation image for Ubuntu 20.04.

4\. Adequate system resources: Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements to run both Windows 10 and VirtualBox smoothly. Make sure you have enough RAM, CPU power, and disk space available for virtualization.

With these prerequisites in place, you’re all set to begin the installation process. Follow the steps outlined in this tutorial to set up Ubuntu 20.04 on VirtualBox and unlock a whole new world of possibilities.

1.  Install Virtual box from the below link [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2.  Open Virtual Box

3\. Download Ubuntu OS , here is the version of Ubuntu 20.04 [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.3&architecture=amd64](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.3&architecture=amd64)

4\. Click on **New** Button in Virtual Box and enter the name of the Operating System as per your understanding like I wrote Ubuntu, the Type Section must be Linux bcoz we are installing Linux OS and Ubuntu is a flavor of Linux OS. In the version, select the architecture of the OS which could be 32-bit or 64-bit. So here my architecture is 64-bit. And, the section of Machine Folder which will be by default because all the other files related to the virtual box have already been installed.

5\. Now after clicking on Next,

The next thing will appear to allocate the size for Ubuntu OS. Try to select the size up to the green mark which is safe and easily operable by virtual box and. Click on next.
