Terraform

**What is Terraform?**

For those not familiar with Terraform, it’s a well-known tool used to create infrastructures on platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, and more, all through code. This concept is also called Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Previously, Terraform operated under the MPL 2.0 License. However, on August 10th, 2023, Terraform made an announcement that it was updating its license from MPL 2.0 to the Business Source License.

**What is MPL 2.0?**  
MPL stands for Mozilla Public License, and version 2.0 (MPL 2.0) is a type of open-source software license.

> Example:  
> Imagine there’s a cool open-source project called “AwesomeApp” released under the MPL 2.0 license. You decide to use this app for your DevOps work. You find a bug in the app that’s causing some issues. So, being the skilled DevOps engineer you are, you fix the bug and make the app work even better.

> Now, here’s where the MPL 2.0 license comes into play: Since “AwesomeApp” is licensed under MPL 2.0, you’re free to modify it. But if you distribute your modified version to others — let’s say you share it with your DevOps buddies — you need to follow certain rules.

> You have to provide access to the source code of your modified version. This way, others can see what changes you made, learn from them, and even contribute further. This sharing spirit keeps the open-source community alive and thriving.

> So, in this real-time example, MPL 2.0 encourages you to give back to the community by sharing your improvements. It’s like teamwork in the software world — you benefit from others’ work, and they benefit from yours.

**What is BUSL or BSL?**  
Think of the Business Source License (BSL) as a special way of sharing software. Imagine a company makes a useful software tool, like a fancy calculator. At first, they let everyone use it for free, just like any regular free app.

But here’s the twist: After a certain time, let’s say a year or two, if another company wants to use that calculator in their own product that they sell to customers, they need to talk to the first company. They might need to pay a bit of money or work out an agreement.

> So, in simple terms, BSL lets you use a software tool for free, but if you want to use it to make money, you might need to pay later. It’s like sharing a toy with friends, but if someone wants to use it to earn money at their lemonade stand, they need to ask nicely.

**Why Terraform Changed its License to Business Source License (BSL)?**

Ever wondered why Terraform made the switch in licenses? If you’ve read about MPL and BSL above, you might already have an inkling. Let’s break it down again.

**The Core Issue**

Many organizations use Terraform as their go-to tool. They build, they sell, and they make money. Now, making money from open-source tools is fine, but there’s a snag. Some of these organizations aren’t giving anything back to Terraform such as some percentage of money kind of thing.

**The Fix: BSL**

So, Terraform put on its thinking hat and made a call. They shifted from MPL 2.0 to BSL. Why? To keep things balanced by giving back some kind of money.

**What About Us?**

Now, here’s the part that really matters for us, the Terraform users. If you’re a Terraform Developer or a DevOps champ, don’t fret. This license change isn’t your headache. It’s mostly for the big players — those using Terraform to rake in cash. And even if you’re earning through Terraform, no worries! Just remember to tip your hat to Terraform.
