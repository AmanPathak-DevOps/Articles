### **Introduction**

Understanding the lifecycle of Kubernetes Pods is crucial for effective container orchestration. In this blog post, we will delve into the various states a Pod can go through and the conditions associated with their creation. This knowledge is essential for managing and troubleshooting your Kubernetes workloads.

There are multiple types of states for the Pod lifecycle that we will discuss here:

1.  **Pending**: When a pod is created it has to go through the pending status in which Master nodes allocate the nodes to where to create the pod. The pods will remain in the pending state until all the necessary resources are allocated such as CPU, memory, and storage.
2.  **Running**: Once the pod has been scheduled to a node, it comes into the Running Status. Once the pod comes into a running state, the containers within the pods will be creating and doing the tasks that have been provided in the manifest file.
3.  **Succeeded**: Once the pods have completed their task then, the pods come in the Succeeded state and then terminates.
4.  **Failed**: Once the pods intend to create but due to some issues the pods are not creating and showing the Failed state leads to issues with the configurations which need to be addressed by the creator of the file.
5.  **CrashLoopBackOff**: This is the advanced state of a Failed state where the container is crashing and restarts. To fix this issue, the creator of the file needs to check the manifest file.
6.  **Unknown**: In some cases, the Kubernetes may lose the connection with the nodes to create the pods that show the unknown status of the particular pod.
7.  **Termination**: When a pod is no longer available it comes in the termination process. Once the pod is deleted, it can not restart again the same pods and is removed from the entire Kubernetes cluster.

There are some conditions that come under while creating Pods:

*   **Initialized**: This condition shows whether all the init containers have started successfully or not. If the status is false it means the init containers have not started.
*   **Ready**: This condition shows the pod is ready to use.
*   **ContainersReady**: As the name suggests, if the containers are ready within a pod it will show True in the status.
*   **PodScheduled**: This condition shows that the pod has been scheduled on the node.

> If you create any pod and describe that pod by running the command *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>****.*** You will see the status like this, the pod is scheduled but other things are not because it is in progress.

> After some seconds, if you describe again the same pod. You will see that everything is perfect and configured properly.

### Conclusion

Managing the lifecycle of Kubernetes Pods and understanding their states and conditions is fundamental to ensuring the smooth operation of your containerized applications. By monitoring and troubleshooting these aspects, you can maintain a healthy Kubernetes cluster and deliver reliable services to your users.
