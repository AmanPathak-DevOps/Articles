tfsec

Have you ever wondered how to ensure the security of your Terraform code while creating cloud infrastructure on platforms like AWS and Azure? Enter \`tfsec\`, a specialized security scanner designed to enhance the safety of your Terraform code. In this blog post, we’ll explore what \`tfsec\` is, its key features, benefits, and why you should consider integrating it into your development workflow.

### **What is \`tfsec\`?**

**\`tfsec\`** is a security scanner tool specifically tailored for Terraform code. Its primary purpose is to identify vulnerabilities within your Terraform codebase, significantly improving the security of the infrastructure you create.

### **Key Features and Benefits:**

**1\. Security Scanner for Terraform:** \`tfsec\` is dedicated to scanning Terraform code, meticulously identifying vulnerabilities and security issues that may exist.

**2\. Enhanced Infrastructure Security:** By detecting vulnerabilities early in the development process, \`tfsec\` plays a pivotal role in preventing potential security breaches in your infrastructure.

**3\. CI/CD Integration:** \`tfsec\` seamlessly integrates into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling automated code scanning at different stages of development. This ensures that security checks are an integral part of your development lifecycle.

**4\. Custom Rule Sets:** \`tfsec\` offers customizable rule sets, allowing you to tailor the scanning process to meet the specific security standards and requirements of your organization.

### **Why Should You Use \`tfsec\`?**

1\. **Mitigating Unauthorized Access:** Terraform developers occasionally create resources without adhering to security best practices, potentially leading to unauthorized access. \`tfsec\` identifies these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**2\. Standardization and Compliance:** \`tfsec\` enforces coding standards and ensures compliance with security best practices, guaranteeing that your Terraform code aligns with essential security requirements.

**3\. Early Detection:** By seamlessly integrating \`tfsec\` into your development pipeline, vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development cycle. This reduces the potential impact of security flaws down the line.

**4\. Cost-Effective:** Addressing security vulnerabilities during the development phase is far more cost-effective than remediating issues in a production environment.

**5\. Confidence in Your Infrastructure:** Regularly using \`tfsec\` instills confidence that your infrastructure is designed with security in mind, ultimately reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

### **How to Get Started with \`tfsec\`?**

***To get started with \`tfsec\`, you’ll need to install it. Here’s how:***

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/master/scripts/install\_linux.sh | bash

Once installed, you can check your Terraform code for vulnerabilities using the following command:

  
tfsec <directory\_name>

### **Let’s Dive into a Demo**

Imagine you’ve created an EC2 Instance using Terraform and now want to ensure its security. By running \`tfsec .\`, you can identify vulnerabilities and potential issues in your code. \`tfsec\` not only pinpoints these issues but also provides valuable suggestions on how to address them. Each vulnerability or problem comes with a link to a solution, making it easier for you to enhance your code’s security.

As you can see the issue is with our Terraform Code. Now, to remove the vulnerability. Please click on the blue text out of the two blue texts.

After addressing these vulnerabilities and following \`tfsec\`’s recommendations, running the scan again will ideally yield zero issues, indicating that your code is now more secure.

Jenkins

Taking it a step further, you can integrate \`tfsec\` into your Jenkins or any other CI/CD tool. To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Install \`tfsec\` on your Jenkins server.

2\. In your Jenkinsfile, execute the \`tfsec .\` command within your pipeline.

Once configured, your pipeline will automatically check your Terraform code for vulnerabilities and security issues at each deployment. If any issues arise, the pipeline will flag them, ensuring that only secure and compliant code makes its way to production.

In summary, **\`tfsec\`** empowers you to enhance the security of your Terraform code, providing early detection of vulnerabilities and potential issues. By integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline, you can further automate security checks, reducing the risk of deploying insecure code. With \`tfsec\`, you’ll not only improve your infrastructure’s security but also streamline your development process.
