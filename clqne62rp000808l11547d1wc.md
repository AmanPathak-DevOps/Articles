Three-Tier-Application Infra Diagram

***Introduction***

Unlock the power of Three-Tier Architecture deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the magic of Terraform. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll show you how to effortlessly set up a robust and scalable Three-Tier Architecture with a single command. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you’ll streamline your deployment process, reduce errors, and gain the freedom to focus on your application’s core logic.

***The Power of Automation***

Say goodbye to manual configuration headaches! Automating the deployment of a Three-Tier Architecture isn’t just a convenience — it’s a necessity. As your application grows, ensuring consistent setups becomes a challenge. That’s where Terraform comes in, providing a streamlined approach to effortlessly orchestrate a complete AWS environment. Let’s dive into the nuts and bolts of this game-changing project.

***Project Overview***

Welcome to a world where setting up a Three-Tier Architecture is a breeze. Forget about the complexities of individually configuring AWS services like VPCs, load balancers, databases, and more. Our project encompasses the creation of the entire infrastructure, making sure you’re up and running with minimal effort. We’re not just automating; we’re simplifying the complex!

***Getting Started***

Terraform Code on GitHub

1.  Clone & Navigate: Begin by cloning our GitHub repository T[erraform-for-AWS](https://github.com/AmanPathak-DevOps/Terraform-for-AWS.git) to your local machine. Head into the `Non-Modularized/Three-Tier-Application/` directory to get started.
2.  Customize & Configure: Open the `<`service>.tf file and embark on your journey. Each line comes with a detailed comment, guiding you through essential configurations. Tailor the architecture to your needs, and watch the magic unfold.
3.  Initiate & Deploy: Launch your adventure by initializing the Terraform configuration using `terraform init`. Then, execute the spellbinding command `terraform apply -auto-approve` to witness your AWS Three-Tier Architecture come to life.

***Architecture Enchantment***

1.  VPC: The Foundation: Unleash the potential of your architecture with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This networking marvel provides isolation and segmentation, creating a secure playground for your application.
2.  Load Balancing Magic: Behold the power of the Application Load Balancer (ALB). Seamlessly distribute incoming traffic among web servers, ensuring performance, fault tolerance, and user satisfaction.
3.  Auto Scaling Wonders: Let the Auto Scaling Group weave its magic. By dynamically adjusting the application tier based on demand, it guarantees optimal performance and unparalleled resilience.
4.  Database Sorcery: Enter the realm of databases with Amazon RDS. This managed service transforms the complex database setup into a simple incantation, leaving you free to concentrate on your application logic.
5.  DNS Mastery: Harness the potential of Route 53 for domain registration and DNS management. Instantly transform complex domain handling into a breeze.
6.  Static Content Wizardry: Elevate your architecture with Amazon S3. Transform it into a content haven for static assets, elevating performance and lightening the load on application servers.

***Conclusion & Beyond***

With Terraform by your side, the skies are the limit. Automating your Three-Tier Architecture deployment ensures consistency, reliability, and a shortcut to success. As you embark on your journey, remember that you’re not just automating — you’re revolutionizing.
